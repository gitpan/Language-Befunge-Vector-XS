=head1 NAME

Language::Befunge::Vector::XS - Language::Befunge::Vector rewritten for speed



=head1 DESCRIPTION

The C<Language::Befunge> module makes heavy use of n-dims vectors,
mapped to the C<Language::Befunge::Vector> class. This allows to
abstract the funge dimension while still keeping the same code for the
operations.

However, such an heavy usage does have some impact on the performances.
Therefore, this modules is basically a rewrite of LBV in XS. If
installed, then LBV will automagically load it and replace its own
functions with the XS ones.



=head1 METHODS

This module implements exactly the same api as LBV. Please refer to this
module for more information on the following methods:
